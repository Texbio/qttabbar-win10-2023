# qttabbar-win10-2023
## Why Install QTTabBar?
- Its good for productivity and will keep you from trying to manage files on multiple monitors.
- Text and Image previews (You can add ones not included in the previews section in settings)
- Windows 11 already has this feature, so why cant windows 10?


## Notes
